=== AWS Database Essentials

==== ElastiCache
* two types: Redis and Memchached


==== AWS RDS (relationsal dbs)
* Oracle, MS SQL, MySQL, Postresql, Aurora


==== AWS NoSQL options
* DynamoDB
 * DynamoDB does NOT allow embedded data structures in a nosql document.  Booooo!

==== OLTP vs OLAP
* Online Trnx Processing usually joins records from multiple tables to return 1 (or a small number of rows) at a time
* Online Analytical Processing usually works in large batch modes to reduce big data sets down to summary totals

==== AWS Redshift
* data warehousing service

RDS -> OLTP
DynamoDB -> nosql
Redshift -> OLAP
ElastiCache -> in memory, scalable caching


==== DynamoDB
* fully managed service
* provisioned on SSD for sigle digit millisecond latency
* spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers (not exactly the same as availability zones)
* eventually consisten reads are the default configuration
* Strongly consistent Reads have a gurantee of replication across data centers before returns result.
* DynamoDB Write Capacity Unit: 1 write op per second as a baseline price
		1,000,000 writes per day = 1mm / 24hrs / 60mins / 60secs = 11.2 writes per second
		need to provision 12 DynamoDB Write Capacity Units per day
